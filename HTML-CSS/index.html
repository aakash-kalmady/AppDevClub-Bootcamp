    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Maryland Dhoom was founded in 2010 by a group of students who wanted to
      share their love for Bollywood dance with the UMD community. Since then,
      the team has grown and evolved into a competitive and award-winning dance
      team. We have performed at various events on and off campus, and have won
      numerous awards for our performances. We have also competed in national
      dance competitions and have placed in the top three in our category. We
      are proud of our history and are excited to continue to grow and evolve as
      a team.
